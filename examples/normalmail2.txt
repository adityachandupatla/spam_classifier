Hi Aditya,

We’re writing to let you know that we’ve updated the Magoosh privacy policy as of July 18, 2018. 

Here are some of the highlights about what is different:

We’ve updated our policy to reflect recent changes in privacy laws, both in the US and in other countries
We’ve given you more control of your data and provided detailed instructions on how to opt out of various tracking systems and cookies
Our philosophy around privacy hasn’t changed -- we still take great care to keep your data private and secure. We want to make sure that you’re focusing on achieving your educational goals, not worrying about whether your personal info is safe.  

You can read through the full privacy policy here (great practice for some of those drier reading comprehension passages wink), and let us know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Bhavin
Magoosh CEO
